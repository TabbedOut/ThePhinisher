The Phinisher
=============

Project management for Phabricator. Phabricator has some useful fields when it comes to 
tracking time and estimation, but there's no decent way to unify it.

This project exists solely because I refuse to learn PHP to actually add this into the
main Phabricator ecosystem. 


Expected Configuration
----------------------

For this to work correctly, some assumptions are made.

Set up an Estimated Hours field in Maniphest:

    "phinisher:time-estimation"    : {
        "name"    : "Estimated Hours",
        "type"    : "int",
        "caption" : "Estimated number of hours this will take."
    },
    
After that is set up, these will exist in the 
    `phabricator_maniphest`.`maniphest_customfieldstorage`
table, the fieldIndex will need to be stored in the application.conf
in the `phabricator.estimatedHoursKey` value
